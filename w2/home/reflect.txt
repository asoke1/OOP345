Reflection 
What I learn:
•	subobject:
 	Any object that is stored within another object (array elements, base class objects and data member objects).

•	the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations
	goal of the copy constructor and copy assignment is to make a copy of one object to another,
	the goal of the move constructor and move assignment is to move ownership of the resources from one object to another 
	(which is much less expensive than making a copy and faster because is only moving the exact size).

•	the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves
	because dynamic memory  happens at runtime in the exact match period. It doesn’t have to have a name only a pointer to link to the memory. If the memory stored in the pointer is called only the memory is used.

•	the changes you made in upgrading your w2 and Text modules.
	The upgrading I made is to add move constructor and move operator only to compare where one is faster. 
	Text(Text&&);
	sText& operator=(Text&&);
